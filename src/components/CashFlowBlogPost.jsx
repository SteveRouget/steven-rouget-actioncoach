              In my 23 years of coaching trades and service businesses, I've seen countless business owners get excited about their sales figures while their bank account tells a different story. The harsh reality is that sales don't pay the bills â€“ cash flow does.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Cash Flow Crisis in Trades Businesses</h2>
            
            <p>
              Trades businesses are particularly vulnerable to cash flow problems because of their unique challenges:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>Large upfront material costs</li>
              <li>Extended payment terms with commercial clients</li>
              <li>Seasonal fluctuations in demand</li>
              <li>Equipment and vehicle financing</li>
              <li>Irregular project completion schedules</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mt-8 mb-4">The 13-Week Cash Flow Forecast</h2>
            
            <p>
              The most powerful tool I teach my Project BETA clients is the 13-week rolling cash flow forecast. This simple system helps you predict and prevent cash flow problems before they become critical.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">How it Works:</h3>
              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Track all money coming in (by week)</li>
                <li>Track all money going out (by week)</li>
                <li>Calculate your running cash balance</li>
                <li>Identify potential shortfalls 6-8 weeks in advance</li>
                <li>Take action before problems occur</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mt-8 mb-4">Real Success Story</h2>
            
            <p>
              One of my Navigator-level clients, a building contractor, was constantly stressed about money despite having $2M in annual sales. After implementing the 13-week forecast, he discovered he had a $45,000 cash shortfall coming in 7 weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Instead of panicking when the crisis hit, he took proactive action: negotiated better payment terms with suppliers, offered early payment discounts to clients, and arranged a temporary line of credit. Result? He sailed through the potential crisis and now sleeps better at night.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mt-8 mb-4">Your Action Steps</h2>
            
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>Set up a simple 13-week cash flow forecast</li>
              <li>Update it weekly (every Friday)</li>
              <li>Identify your cash flow patterns</li>
              <li>Create contingency plans for shortfalls</li>
              <li>Celebrate positive cash flow weeks!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Remember: Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business. Manage it well, and your business will thrive. Ignore it, and even profitable businesses can fail.
